The results are saved in a new Excel file, with the Shapiro-Wilk test results and KDE plots for each customer

Anova test
This project analyzes customer sales data from 2020 to 2024 by processing and formatting the raw sales data, followed by performing an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test on the monthly sales data. The results, including F-statistics and p-values, are saved in an Excel file, along with a significance flag indicating whether the differences in sales between months are statistically significant.
